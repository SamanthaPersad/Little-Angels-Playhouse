    <h3>The Story of Little Angels Playhouse</h3>
<p>
For more than 30 years, the founders of Little Angels Playhouse®, the Weissman family, have been positively 
impacting the lives of children by developing and implementing ground-breaking care and early education 
programs throughout the country. Starting in 1980 with a single location in Boca Raton, NY, the unique and 
proprietary programs that the Weissmans developed quickly caught on and expansion soon followed.

The foundation of The Little Angels Playhouse® was built on three key educational and care principles: cognitive,
 physical, and social; or as we say at LAP®, "learn, play, and grow!"
